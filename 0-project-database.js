            "Developed an autonomous camera deployment system for the NASA USLI rocketry competition. The payload extends an imaging sensor outside the vehicle and can be commanded to take photos via radio after landing. The system combines mechanical actuators with autonomous software to monitor flight events and execute the deployment sequence.",
            "During flight, all components remain sealed inside the airframe. Once landing is detected, the system automatically rotates the payload vertical, separates the airframe to create an opening, and extends the camera assembly upward using a rack and pinion. Once deployed, the system receives NASA transmission commands through an integrated antenna and captures images of the landing site.",
